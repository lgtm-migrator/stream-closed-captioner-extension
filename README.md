# React Twitch Extension for Stream Closed Captoiner

This React app that displays Closed Captions for viewers on Twitch. It depends on Closed Captions being publish from the companion website https://stream-cc.gooseman.codes

## Requirements

There is only one requirement to use this example. 

* Node.JS LTS or greater. 

You may also find that using `yarn` is easier than `npm`, so we do recommend installing that as well by running: 
```
npm i -g yarn
``` 
in an elevated command line interface.

## First time Usage

To use this, simply clone the repository into the folder of your choice. 

Next, do the following: 

1. Change directories into the cloned folder.
2. Run `yarn install` to install all prerequisite packages needed to run the template. 
3. Run `yarn cert` to generate the needed certificates. This allows the server to be run over HTTPS vs. HTTP.
4. Run `yarn start` to run the sample.

## Usage

To build your finalized React JS files, simply run `yarn build` to build the various webpacked files.
